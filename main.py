To create an `eco-shipment-optimizer` for optimizing delivery routes and load planning to minimize carbon emissions and reduce costs, we need to consider the following:

1. **Input Data**: The tool requires input data, which typically includes vehicle capacities, available routes, distance information, and possibly carbon emission factors for different vehicle types.

2. **Optimization Goal**: Minimize carbon emissions and costs. This typically involves finding the shortest or most fuel-efficient routes and optimizing the load distribution among available vehicles.

3. **Tools and Libraries**: Python has several libraries that can help with optimization, including `networkx` for graph-based route optimization and `numpy` for numerical calculations. For routing problems, `ortools` (Google's Optimization Tools) can be useful.

Below is a simple version of an eco-shipment-optimizer. This version focuses on using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path while considering carbon emissions and also includes load optimization. Note that this is a simplified approach; real-world logistics optimization can be much more complex.

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

class EcoShipmentOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a directed graph
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()
    
    def add_route(self, source, target, distance, emission_factor, cost):
        """
        Add route information to the graph.
        source: starting point
        target: destination point

        cost: transportation cost per unit distance for this route
        """
        self.graph.add_edge(source, target, distance=distance, emission=emission_factor * distance, cost=cost * distance)

    def calculate_min_emission_path(self, source, target):

        """
        try:
            # Get the shortest path based on emission
            path = nx.shortest_path(self.graph, source, target, weight='emission')
            emission = nx.shortest_path_length(self.graph, source, target, weight='emission')

            cost = nx.shortest_path_length(self.graph, source, target, weight='cost')
            return path, cost
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
            return [], float('inf')

    def optimize_load(self, demands, vehicle_capacity):
        """

### Comments:
- The **graph** represents the network of routes, with **nodes** as locations and **edges** as routes with associated distances, emission factors, and costs.
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** is employed for calculating the shortest paths based on emissions or costs using NetworkX's built-in functionality.
- `optimize_load` function distributes loads efficiently among available vehicles based on their capacity.
- Basic error handling is included in the main function to catch exceptions and ensure that the program does not crash unexpectedly.

### Considerations:
- This example is highly simplified and doesn't take into account dynamic factors such as traffic, real-time fuel prices, or delivery time constraints. 
- In practice, integration with GPS and real-time data sources might also be required for more precise optimization.
